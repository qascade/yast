yast does not support windows and wsl2.

## Issue with Windows support

As the config utilities were developed keeping Unix File System in mind, the config utils will not exibit same behaviour of Windows File System

## Issue with WSL2 support

Since yast works with targets that require VPN access to fetch results we need to set up a VPN connection in WSL2. However, WSL2 currently does not support VPN.

## Approach To Solve This

The current approach is to create a Docker image for yast to extend its support for multiple platforms. As discussed in #58.

# Contributing Guidelines

Contributions are always welcome!

**Before spending lots of time on something, ask for feedback on your idea first!**


Please search issues and pull requests before adding something new to avoid duplicating
efforts and conversations.


This project welcomes non-code contributions, too! The following types of contributions
are welcome:

- **Ideas**: participate in an issue thread or start your own to have your voice heard.
- **Writing**: contribute your expertise in an area by helping expand the included docs.
- **Copy editing**: fix typos, clarify language, and improve the quality of the docs.
- **Formatting**: help keep docs easy to read with consistent formatting.

## Code Style

This repository uses `gofmt` to maintain code style and consistency. 
Please run `gofmt -s -w .` before pushing the commits. 

## Project Governance

Individuals making significant and valuable contributions are given commit-access to the
project to contribute as they see fit. But the final say of whether a pull request is to be merged remains with the project owners. 

### Rules

There are a few basic ground-rules for contributors:

1. **No `--force` pushes** or modifying the Git history in any way.
2. **Non-main branches** should be used for ongoing work.
3. **Significant modifications** like target changes should be subject to a **pull request**
   to solicit feedback from other contributors.
4. **Pull requests** are *encouraged* for all contributions to solicit feedback, but left to
   the discretion of the contributor.
5. **Pull requests** require atleast one approval from collaborators with write access before merge to **main**. 
6. **Pull requests** must pass all the workflows before merging into **main**.  

### Releases

Declaring formal releases remains the prerogative of the project maintainer.

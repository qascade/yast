## 📝 NOTE
1. The current supported target requires VPN to get results. Please make sure that you are connected to a **VPN Server** before searching or you may not get the results. We personally recommend using CloudFlare Warp. You can [download](https://1.1.1.1/) it here.
2. The Project is still in development stage. So, you might see undesired behaviour while using yast. Please file an issue if you experience any bugs or undesired behaviour. 
3. yast does not support WSL2, because the current targets available in yast, only work with VPN and it's very difficult to establish a VPN connection on WSL2.
